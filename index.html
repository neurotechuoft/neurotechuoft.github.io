        <h1>FAQ</h1>


        <h3>What is neurotechnology?</h3>

        <p>In the field of neurotech, we look into how the brain works, and how technology can work with in conjunction with the brain. It often uses brain-computer interfaces to have minds and machines work together.</p>

        <h3>What is a brain computer interface (BCI)? How do they work?</h3>
        <p>A BCI is a system that lets your brain communicate and work with a computer! The difference is that the BCI tries to 'read your mind', instead of you telling it what your emotions or thoughts are. There are three steps. Step one is to obtain and 'clean' your brain signals (and other biosignals, such as eye movement, heart rate, etc). Next, the BCI interprets the information, and finally does some sort of action according to your brain state. The main difference is that whatever action the BCI does FEEDS BACK to the brain! This can be through any sensory feelings like sight and touch, or even directly affecting brain function! Applications of BCIs range from mind-controlling prosthetics to chips embedded inside your brain to detect and stop seizures.</p>


        <h3>What type of projects do you work on?</h3>
        <p>Our first project is making a mind-controlled bot! (It isn't quite as hard as you might imagine it to be; we're mostly using other people's code :P). We're also participating in a Canada-wide neurotechnology competition in Montreal where we have to a) make a biosignals board and b) make our own neurotech application! We also have a bunch of neurological and cognitive science studies being planned out for the future, so stay tuned!</p>

        <h3>I'm in first year and I don't know much about neuroscience and/or computer science. Can I still join, and what would I be doing?</h3>
        <p>Of course you can join! That being said, you will be expected to do quite a bit of self-learning (and this isn't just limited to first years). If you have a bit of experience coding, or are teaching yourself how to code, you can contribute to our source code for projects such as our mind-controlled bot. If you have a background in the sciences, you'll be able to help us find key literature and methods to guide our projects. Whatever your background is, it is very helpful to familiarize yourself with the other aspects of neurotechnology so that you understand how everything works together</p>

        <h3>NeurotechX Student Competition</h3>
        <p>We will be participating in a Canada-wide neurotechnology student competition, and our teams are hard at work! Here's a <a href="/Files/NeuroTechX-StudentClubCompetition-Validation.pdf">link to the instructions. </a></p>
        <h3>NeurotechUofT Prezis</h3>
        <p>The members of NeurotechUofT created some awesome <a href="https://prezi.com/user/v1u3a0hqncba/" target="_blank">prezi workshops</a> for an intro to the concepts in BCI design! We highly recommend running through the prezis if you're new to BCI design.

        <p>TL;DR</p>

        <p>-We have a Slack!</p>
        <p>-We have a software team for WallEEG Mind-Controlled Bot!</p>

        <br>&nbsp;</br>

        <p>Hey everyone! Thanks for everyone who came out to our software scrum! The WallEEG project is well on its way, and we're working on putting all the pieces together. We're also forming our team to make a biosignals board for NeurotechX's Student Competition. Finally, we are collaborating with NeurotechTO on a software project of our own!</p>

        <p>On the administrative side, our team's hard at work to build industry partnerships so that we can see all the cool neurotech innovations happening in the real world. The hardware we bought last semester is finally trickling in, and we're really excited to use all of it!</p>
        <p>NEXT STEPS: </p>
        <p>-finish putting the pieces of the bot together!</p>
        <p>-find a cool project to work on for NeurotechX's competition</p>


        <p>That's all for now; stay tuned!</p>
        <br>&nbsp;</br>
